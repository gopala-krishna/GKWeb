                                    When we ask the value of PI to any radom person, we get different answers such as :<br />
                                    <br />
                                    1. 22/7<br />
                                    2. 3.14<br />
                                    3. 3.14 with infinite deiclmals<br />
                                    4. 3.14 with infinite decimals and non consecutive repeating decimals<br />
                                    5. 333/106
        6. is a greek symbol<br />
                                    <br />

                                    All of them are tends to be correct but the accurate answer is :
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Pi is the ratio beteween a circle's circumference and it's diameter<br />

                                    PI is an infinite, non-repeating decimal - meaning that every possible number combination exists some where in PI.

                                    PI is transcendental means the number can't be the solution to any polynomial that has rational number coefficients. In other words,
        there's no finite, root-finding formula that can be used to calculate PI using rational numbers.

                                    Literary nerds invented a dialect known as Pilish, in which the numbers of letters in successive words match the digits of PI. 
        For example, Mike Keith wrote the book "Not A Wake" (Vinculum Press, 2010) entirely in Pilish

                                    ("Now" has three letters, "I" has one letter, "fall" has four letters, and so on.)<br />

                                    The record for the most digits of PI memorized belongs to Rajveer Meena of Vellore, India, who recited 70,000 decimal places of March 21, 2015, according to Guinness World Records. Previously, Chao Lu, of China, who recited PI from memory 
 to 67,890 places in 2005, held the record, according to Guinness World Records.<br />
                                    The unofficial record holder is Akira Haraguchi, who videotaped a performance of his recitation of 100,000 decimal
 places of pPIi in 2005, and more recently topped 117,000 decimal places, the Guardian reported

                                    Number enthusiasts have memorized many digits of PI. Many people use memory aids, such as mnemonic techniques known as piphilology, to help them remember. Often, they use poems written in Pilish (in which the number of letters in each word corresponds to a digit of PI), such as this excerpt:<br />

                                <div class="content padding10">
                                    <br />

                                    Those who are hoping to calculate PI using an old-fashioned technique can accomplish the task using a ruler, a can and a piece of string, or a
        protractor and a pencil. The downside of the can method is that it requires a can that is actually round, and the accuracy is limited by how
        well a person can loop string around its circumference. Similarly, drawing a circle with a protractor and then measuring its diameter or
        radius with a ruler involves a fair amount of dexterity and precision.<br />

                                    A more precise option is to use geometry. Break up a circle into multiple segments (such as eight or 10 pizza slices). 
        Then, calculate the length of a straight line that would turn the slice into an isosceles triangle, which has two sides of equal length.
        Adding up all the sides yields a rough approximation for PI. The more slices you create, the more accurate the approximation of PI will be.

                                    Mathematicians still don't know whether PI belongs in the club of so-called normal numbers — or numbers that have the same
        frequency of all the digits — meaning that 0 through 9 each occur 10 percent of the time, according to Trueb's website pi2e.ch. In
        a paper published Nov. 30, 2016, in the preprint journal arXiv, Trueb calculated that, at least based on the first 2.24 trillion digits, 
        the frequency of the numbers 0 through 9 suggest pi is normal. Of course, given that PI has an infinite number of digits, the only 
        way to show this for sure is to create an airtight math proof. So far, proofs for this most famous of irrational numbers has eluded 
        scientists, though they have come up with some bounds on the properties and distribution of its digits.
